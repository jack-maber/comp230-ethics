# Research Question
"Can the way that user stories are prioritised and allocated I.E. "MoSCoW method" have an impact on the length of a sprint in the video games industry?"

# Proposal
My agile development question revolves around one specific part of the Agile Development process and that is "User Stories", and how I intend to answer the aforementioned question is to delve deeper into first, what a User Story is and how it is used by members of the development team in the development cycle to create a finished product, and then go further and look at how the user stories are created in the first place, and thus prioritised amongst the team members and on the Scrum Board, and as there are different methods of prioritising these user stories such as Walking Skeleton and the MoSCow method, I will compare and contrast these individual methods, and by using my research gained from my noted sources, I will be able to ascertain which is the most efficent for teams in a games development environment. And from these reflections on the different methods and the ways that they change the development teams behaviour and work pattern I will be able to draw a final conclusion on my question and wheter futher research is required to gain a better understanding of the impact it can have on the development time of a project in the video games industry.
