\section{Introduction}
My essay will be on Should game developers take responsibility for violent actions that occur as a result of their products? With nearly every violent event that happens around the world, video games are more than likely going to be brought in as one of the main factors for the perpetrators actions, especially after events such as the Columbine Massacre really brought forward the idea that games that contain violence could influence people to commit such horrific acts, but is there a link?
